# SQL - Syntax Basics

## Basic concepts:

### ðŸ§© Keywords

- SQL **keywords are not case-sensitive**: `SELECT`, `select`, and `SeLeCt` are equivalent.
- Conventionally, **uppercase is used** for keywords to improve readability.

### ðŸ“‹ Query Structure

A basic SQL query typically consists of:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

- **SELECT**: list of fields to retrieve
- **FROM**: target table
- **WHERE**: (optional) filter condition

> The semicolon `;` at the end is used to **terminate statements**. Itâ€™s **optional** in many tools, but recommended.

### ðŸ’¬ Comments

SQL supports two types of comments:

```sql
-- This is a single-line comment

/*
 This is a
 multi-line comment
*/
```

---

### ðŸ§ª Example

```sql
-- Query: get employee by salary > 1800

SELECT name, hiring_date, salary
FROM employee
WHERE salary > 1800;
```
